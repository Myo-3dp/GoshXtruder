# GoshXtruder

**"Good Old SHerpa" eXtruder**

 - [Sherpa Micro](https://github.com/Annex-Engineering/Sherpa_Micro-Extruder) inspired
 - Original design

**GoshXtruder** introduces composite material design by combining 3D printed and aluminum parts to enable simple making of complex functional parts, yet achieving maximum rigidity.

## Features
GoshXtruder follows design guidelines with the goal of easy making and assembly of the extruder that is compatible with standard 3D printing parts. It also takes into the account possible variations in size of stock parts and makes adjustments easy.

 - Sherpa Micro compatible mounting holes
 - BMG Reverse Drive Gear compatible
 - Low center of mass of the motor
 - Lightweight
 - Great structural rigidity
 - 3D Printing without supports
 - One sided CNC machining

Some design elements are implemented to achieve simplicity of making parts and additional rigidity:
 - Split front element to aluminum part and 3D printed part
 - Using screw in tapped aluminum parts as idler shaft
 - Thick idler arm
 - Optimized filament guides and path

Recommended material for 3D printed parts is PCABS but ABS or ASA should also be fine.

## Flavors (available soon on GitHub)
GoshXtruder comes in two more flavors that are entirely 3D printed but use identical core elements of the original version. Simplicity and rigidity are also main guidelines in this two flavors.
